  abstract = {In this study hyperspectral imaging (380–1020~nm) and machine learning were utilised to develop a technique for detecting different disease development stages (asymptomatic, early, intermediate, and late disease stage) of powdery mildew (PM) in squash. Data were collected in the laboratory as well as in the field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Radial basis function (RBF) was used to discriminate between healthy and diseased plants, and to classify the severity level (disease stage) of a plant; the most significant bands to differentiate between healthy and different stages of disease development were selected (388~nm, 591~nm, 646~nm, 975~nm, and 1012~nm). Furthermore, 29 spectral vegetation indices (VIs) were tested and evaluated for their ability to detect and classify healthy and PM-infected plants; the M value was used to evaluate the VIs. The water index (WI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) were able to accurately detect and classify PM in asymptomatic, early, and late development stages under laboratory conditions. Under field conditions (UAV-based), the spectral ratio of 761 (SR761) accurately detected PM in early stages, and the chlorophyll index green (CI green), the normalised difference of 750/705 (ND 750/705), the green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and the spectral ratio of 850 (SR850) in late stages. The classification results, by using RBF, in laboratory conditions for the asymptomatic and late stage was 82\% and 99\% respectively, while in field conditions it was 89\% and 96\% in early and late disease development stages, respectively.},

Crop-Convolutional neural network (CNN) depiction is that several scholars have used the approaches of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques and have configured their models to specific crops to diagnose plant diseases. In this logic, it is unjustifiable to apply crop-specific models as farmers are resource-poor and possess a low digital literacy level. This study presents a Slender-CNN model of plant disease detection in corn (C), rice (R) and wheat (W) crops. The designed architecture incorporates parallel convolution layers of different dimensions in order to localize the lesions with multiple scales accurately. The experimentation results show that the designed network achieves the accuracy of 88.54\% as well as overcomes several benchmark CNN models: VGG19, EfficientNetb6, ResNeXt, DenseNet201, AlexNet, YOLOv5 and MobileNetV3. In addition, the validated model demonstrates its effectiveness as a multi-purpose device by correctly categorizing the healthy and the infected class of individual types of crops, providing 99.81\%, 87.11\%, and 98.45\% accuracy for CRW crops, respectively. Furthermore, considering the best performance values achieved and compactness of the proposed model, it can be employed for on-farm agricultural diseased crops identification finding applications even in resource-limited settings.},

A subset of artificial intelligence, namely machine learning, has a considerable potential to handle numerous challenges in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems. The present study aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing the recent scholarly literature based on keywords' combinations of ``machine learning'' along with ``crop management'', ``water management'', ``soil management'', and ``livestock management'', and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers were considered eligible that were published within 2018--2020. The results indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines that favour convergence research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was observed to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient. In addition, maize and wheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated crops and animals, respectively. Finally, a variety of sensors, attached on satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been utilized as a means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated that this study will constitute a beneficial guide to all stakeholders towards enhancing awareness of the potential advantages of using machine learning in agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research on this topic.},

This survey paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of the integration of vision-based intelligent systems in various aspects of precision agriculture. By providing a detailed discussion on key areas of digital life cycle of crops, this survey contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities associated with the implementation of vision-guided intelligent systems in challenging agricultural environments. The focus of this survey is to explore widely used imaging and image analysis techniques being utilized for precision farming tasks. This paper first discusses various salient crop metrics used in digital agriculture. Then this paper illustrates the usage of imaging and computer vision techniques in various phases of digital life cycle of crops in precision agriculture, such as image acquisition, image stitching and photogrammetry, image analysis, decision making, treatment, and planning. After establishing a thorough understanding of related terms and techniques involved in the implementation of vision-based intelligent systems for precision agriculture, the survey concludes by outlining the challenges associated with implementing generalized computer vision models for real-time deployment of fully autonomous farms.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

The objective is to develop robust models capable of accurately identifying plant diseases across various image backgrounds, thereby overcoming the limitations of existing methods that often rely on controlled laboratory conditions. To achieve this, a combination of the PlantDoc dataset and Web-sourced data of plant images from online platforms was used. This paper implemented and compared state-of-the-art *cnn architectures, including EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B3, ResNet50, and DenseNet201, all fine-tuned specifically for leaf disease classification. A significant contribution is the application of enhanced data augmentation techniques, such as adding Gaussian noise, to improve model generalisation. Results indicated varied performance across the datasets, with EfficientNet models generally outperforming others. When trained and tested on the PlantDoc dataset, EfficientNet-B3 achieved the highest accuracy of 73.31\%. In cross-dataset evaluation, EfficientNet-B3 reached 76.77\% accuracy when trained on PlantDoc and tested on the Web-sourced dataset. The best performance occurred when training on the combined dataset and testing on the Web-sourced data, resulting in an accuracy of 80.19\%. Class-wise F1-scores revealed consistently high performance (\&gt;0.90) for diseases such as apple rust leaf and grape leaf across models. This paper contributes to the comparative analysis of various datasets and model architectures for effective leaf disease detection.},

Disease infection poses the most significant challenge in crop production, potentially leading to economic losses. Viruses, fungi, bacteria, and other infectious organisms can affect numerous plant parts, including roots, stems, and leaves. Traditional techniques for plant disease detection are timeconsuming, require expertise, and are resource-intensive. Therefore, automated leaf disease diagnosis using artificial intelligence (AI) with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors methodologies are considered for the analysis and detection. This research examines four crop diseases: tomato, chilli, potato, and cucumber. It also highlights the most prevalent diseases and infections in these four types of vegetables, along with their symptoms. This review provides detailed predetermined steps to predict plant diseases using AI. Predetermined steps include image acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature selection, and classification. Machine learning (ML) and deep understanding (DL) detection models are discussed. A comprehensive examination of various existing ML and DL-based studies to detect the disease of the following four crops is discussed, including the datasets used to evaluate these studies. We also provided the list of plant disease detection datasets. Finally, different ML and DL application problems are identified and discussed, along with future research prospects, by combining AI with IoT platforms like smart drones for field-based disease detection and monitoring. This work will help other practitioners in surveying different plant disease detection strategies and the limits of present systems.},

  abstract = {Disease incidence on fluted pumpkin in South Eastern Nigeria was evaluated. This was done with the view to knowing the disease types, damage and management practices for such disease and hence, aims to increase yield of the crop. The method adopted was research approach. Literature were consulted and documented. From the study, a host of biotic agents pose threat to the production of fluted pumpkin including bacteria, fungal and viral pathogens. The best management measure to adopt involves the integrated pest management which should incorporate biological, cultural, chemical and physical methods of disease control. However, some farmers still involve solely on the so used of synthetic chemicals which is not environment friendly. The result gotten from the study can be used to advise farmers in disease management for optimum yield of fluted pumpkin.},

  abstract = {Plants play a crucial role in supplying food globally. Various environmental factors lead to plant diseases which results in significant production losses. However, manual detection of plant diseases is a time-consuming and error-prone process. It can be an unreliable method of identifying and preventing the spread of plant diseases. Adopting advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) can help to overcome these challenges by enabling early identification of plant diseases. In this paper, the recent advancements in the use of ML and DL techniques for the identification of plant diseases are explored. The research focuses on publications between 2015 and 2022, and the experiments discussed in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of using these techniques in improving the accuracy and efficiency of plant disease detection. This study also addresses the challenges and limitations associated with using ML and DL for plant disease identification, such as issues with data availability, imaging quality, and the differentiation between healthy and diseased plants. The research provides valuable insights for plant disease detection researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals by offering solutions to these challenges and limitations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in this field, highlighting the benefits and limitations of these methods, and proposing potential solutions to overcome the challenges of their implementation.},

  abstract = {Conventional techniques for identifying plant leaf diseases can be labor-intensive and complicated. This research uses artificial intelligence (AI) to propose an automated solution that improves plant disease detection accuracy to overcome the difficulty of the conventional methods. Our proposed method uses deep learning (DL) to extract features from photos of plant leaves and machine learning (ML) for further processing. To capture complex illness patterns, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG19 and Inception v3 are utilized. Four distinct datasets---Banana Leaf, Custard Apple Leaf and Fruit, Fig Leaf, and Potato Leaf---were used in this investigation. The experimental results we received are as follows: for the Banana Leaf dataset, the combination of Inception v3 with SVM proved good with an Accuracy of 91.9\%, Precision of 92.2\%, Recall of 91.9\%, F1 score of 91.6\%, AUC of 99.6\% and MCC of 90.4\%, FFor the Custard Apple Leaf and Fruit dataset, the combination of VGG19 with kNN with an Accuracy of 99.1\%, Precision of 99.1\%, Recall of 99.1\%, F1 score of 99.1\%, AUC of 99.1\%, and MCC of 99\%, and for the Fig Leaf dataset with Accuracy of 86.5\%, Precision of 86.5\%, Recall of 86.5\%, F1 score of 86.5\%, AUC of 93.3\%, and MCC of 72.2\%.

  abstract = {Amidst the growing food demands of an increasing population, agricultural intensification frequently depends on excessive chemical and fertilizer applications. While this approach initially boosts crop yields, it effects long-term sustainability through soil degradation and compromised food quality. Thus, prioritizing soil health while enhancing crop production is essential for sustainable food production. Site-Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM) emerges as a critical strategy to increase crop production, maintain soil health, and reduce environmental pollution. Despite its potential, the application of SSNM technologies remain limited in farmers' fields due to existing research gaps. This review critically analyzes and presents research conducted in SSNM in the past 11 years (2013--2024), identifying gaps and future research directions. A comprehensive study of 97 relevant research publications reveals several key findings: a) Electrochemical sensing and spectroscopy are the two widely explored areas in SSNM research, b) Despite numerous technologies in SSNM, each has its own limitation, preventing any single technology from being ideal, c) The selection of models and preprocessing techniques significantly impacts nutrient prediction accuracy, d) No single sensor or sensor combination can predict all soil properties, as suitability is highly attribute-specific. This review provides researchers, and technical personnel in precision agriculture, and farmers with detailed insights into SSNM research, its implementation, limitations, challenges, and future research directions.},
