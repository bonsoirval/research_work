A subset of artificial intelligence, namely machine learning, has a considerable potential to handle numerous challenges in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems. The present study aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing the recent scholarly literature based on keywords' combinations of ``machine learning'' along with ``crop management'', ``water management'', ``soil management'', and ``livestock management'', and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers were considered eligible that were published within 2018--2020. The results indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines that favour convergence research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was observed to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient. In addition, maize and wheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated crops and animals, respectively. Finally, a variety of sensors, attached on satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been utilized as a means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated that this study will constitute a beneficial guide to all stakeholders towards enhancing awareness of the potential advantages of using machine learning in agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research on this topic.},

This transformation not only promises increased productivity and economic growth, but also has the potential to address important global issues such as food security and sustainability. This survey paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of the integration of vision-based intelligent systems in various aspects of precision agriculture. By providing a detailed discussion on key areas of digital life cycle of crops, this survey contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities associated with the implementation of vision-guided intelligent systems in challenging agricultural environments. The focus of this survey is to explore widely used imaging and image analysis techniques being utilized for precision farming tasks. This paper first discusses various salient crop metrics used in digital agriculture. Then this paper illustrates the usage of imaging and computer vision techniques in various phases of digital life cycle of crops in precision agriculture, such as image acquisition, image stitching and photogrammetry, image analysis, decision making, treatment, and planning. After establishing a thorough understanding of related terms and techniques involved in the implementation of vision-based intelligent systems for precision agriculture, the survey concludes by outlining the challenges associated with implementing generalized computer vision models for real-time deployment of fully autonomous farms.},

  abstract = {Plants play a crucial role in supplying food globally. Various environmental factors lead to plant diseases which results in significant production losses. However, manual detection of plant diseases is a time-consuming and error-prone process. It can be an unreliable method of identifying and preventing the spread of plant diseases. Adopting advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) can help to overcome these challenges by enabling early identification of plant diseases. In this paper, the recent advancements in the use of ML and DL techniques for the identification of plant diseases are explored. The research focuses on publications between 2015 and 2022, and the experiments discussed in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of using these techniques in improving the accuracy and efficiency of plant disease detection. This study also addresses the challenges and limitations associated with using ML and DL for plant disease identification, such as issues with data availability, imaging quality, and the differentiation between healthy and diseased plants. The research provides valuable insights for plant disease detection researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals by offering solutions to these challenges and limitations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in this field, highlighting the benefits and limitations of these methods, and proposing potential solutions to overcome the challenges of their implementation.},

  abstract = {Amidst the growing food demands of an increasing population, agricultural intensification frequently depends on excessive chemical and fertilizer applications. While this approach initially boosts crop yields, it effects long-term sustainability through soil degradation and compromised food quality. Thus, prioritizing soil health while enhancing crop production is essential for sustainable food production. Site-Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM) emerges as a critical strategy to increase crop production, maintain soil health, and reduce environmental pollution. Despite its potential, the application of SSNM technologies remain limited in farmers' fields due to existing research gaps. This review critically analyzes and presents research conducted in SSNM in the past 11 years (2013--2024), identifying gaps and future research directions. A comprehensive study of 97 relevant research publications reveals several key findings: a) Electrochemical sensing and spectroscopy are the two widely explored areas in SSNM research, b) Despite numerous technologies in SSNM, each has its own limitation, preventing any single technology from being ideal, c) The selection of models and preprocessing techniques significantly impacts nutrient prediction accuracy, d) No single sensor or sensor combination can predict all soil properties, as suitability is highly attribute-specific. This review provides researchers, and technical personnel in precision agriculture, and farmers with detailed insights into SSNM research, its implementation, limitations, challenges, and future research directions.},
